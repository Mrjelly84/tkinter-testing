the Inventory app.py is all you need , the username and password is admin, password. This is just a prototype  hence no hashing of password etc

if you are runnning this in linux , you will need make sure that you have tkinter installed , if you get a tkinter related error run:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-tk
